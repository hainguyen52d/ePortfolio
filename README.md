### Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science Journey

### SECTION 1: PROFESSIONAL SELF-ASSESSMENT
I embarked on my academic journey towards a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at SNHU in January 2019. Throughout this program, I've actively participated in diverse applications and collaborative projects, gaining valuable experience in teamworkâ€”a skill acknowledged as pivotal in the professional world. Effectively communicating technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders has become second nature, exemplified by my ability to present and explain my work to individuals without a technical background. 

In the software engineering course, I embraced Agile methodologies to proficiently manage the development lifecycle. Implementing a robust database schema and executing CRUD operations, I ensured data integrity, showcasing my proficiency in software engineering and database management. Emphasizing security best practices, I consistently integrated safeguards against potential vulnerabilities into my projects across various courses, underlining the critical role of security in software development. As I navigated through the program, a distinct passion for databases emerged. This realization has significantly influenced my professional aspirations, developing my goal of becoming a Database Analyst. I now value my experiences in learning MySQL as a key component of my problem-solving approach in the ever-evolving field of computer science.
