### Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science Journey

### SECTION 1: PROFESSIONAL SELF-ASSESSMENT
I embarked on my academic journey towards a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at SNHU in January 2019. Throughout this program, I've actively participated in diverse applications and collaborative projects, gaining valuable experience in teamworkâ€”a skill acknowledged as pivotal in the professional world. Effectively communicating technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders has become second nature, exemplified by my ability to present and explain my work to individuals without a technical background.
